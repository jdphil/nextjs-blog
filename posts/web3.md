I've been looking into **Web3** for the last few months and wanted to summarise my findings below.

One of the best explainations I've seen is as follows.

- Web 1.0 = Basic, read only web
- Web 2.0 = Creator web, but centeralised to big platforms Facebook, Twitter etc. Your data is the product, you are being sold.
- Web 3.0 = Decentralised, permissionless web.
